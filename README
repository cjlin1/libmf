Installation and Data Format
============================

LIBMF requires Unix systems and g++ 4.6 or higher.

On Unix systems, type

    $ make

to build the ``libmf'' program.


The data format is:

    <user_id> <item_id> <rating>


Quick Start
===========

You can simply type

    $ ./demo.sh

to run a demonstration.


The workflow of LIBMF is:

    text_train_file =======> binary_train_file =======> model
                    convert                     train              
    
                                               <model>
    text_test_file  =======> binary_test_file  =======> prediction
                    convert                    predict


First we convert both training and test files from text files to binary files
because it reduces data loading time significantly. 

    $ ./libmf convert train_file binary_train_file
    $ ./libmf convert test_file binary_test_file
    [output skipped]

Then we learn a model from the binary training file.

    $ ./libmf train binary_train_file model
    [output skipped]

Finally, we use the model to predict the binary test file.

    $ ./libmf predict binary_test_file model output
    [output skipped]


Formulation
===========

For the detail of how we solve the above problem, please check Appendix A in [1].


Usage
=====

There are five commands in LIBMF: convert, train, predict, and view. You
can check the instruction of these commands by running:

    $ ./libmf

To check the usage of each command, please run:

    $ ./libmf COMMAND
